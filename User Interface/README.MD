How to run the code:
- First, user needs to have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to run the program.
- Download the required packages needed to run the code according to this list:
	1. nltk
	2. sklearn
	3. imblearn
	4. pickle
	5. tkinter.
- In the train_model.ipynb file, user is required to run the cells step by step in order.
- train_model.ipynb needs to run just once as it will generate the finalized model and save it
as finalized_model.sav. 
- In case the finalized_model.sav and feature.pkl file is lost or corrupted, 
user is required to rerun train_model.ipynb again.
- Then, open UserInterface.ipynb and run all the cells in order. The final cell will generate the
user interface. 
- User is able to input any review texts to get the rating. 

How to run the test:
The test files are in test_train_model.ipynb and UI_test.ipynb.
Open the file and run the cell.
